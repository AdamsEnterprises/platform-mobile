# platform-mobile

Currently a very basic skeleton app for ionic+cordova.

## Get installed for dev

```
git clone git@github.com:ushahidi/platform-mobile
cd platform-mobile
npm install -g ionic cordova
npm install
ionic serve
```

## Run your app in the browser (great for initial development)

```
ionic serve
```

## Run on a device or simulator

```
ionic run android
```


Originally created by doing:

```
ionic start platform-mobile --v2
cd platform-mobile
ionic platform add android
```
